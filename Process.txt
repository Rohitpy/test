1.1	Identify GenAI use case and success KPIs	• Business Head and SME will identify key GenAI applications (chatbot, content generation, summarization, etc.)
• Define measurable KPIs post-deployment (response quality, automation %, etc.)	Business Head	2 Sprints
1.2	Define problem statement and response expectations	• SME to share a clear and concise prompt-response requirement
• Include tone, format, accuracy expectations	Business SME	1 Sprint
1.3	Collect domain-specific data	• SME identifies relevant documents, FAQs, chats, etc.
• Data Scientist checks quality, format, and cleans the data	Data Scientist / SME	3 Sprints
1.4	Prepare knowledge base / embeddings	• Prepare vector store if using RAG
• Convert structured/unstructured data into embeddings
• Ensure relevancy and retrieval effectiveness	Data Scientist	2 Sprints
1.5	Prompt engineering & template design	• Design and test prompts for different scenarios
• Use few-shot, chain-of-thought, or template-based prompts as per use case	GenAI Engineer	2 Sprints
1.6	Fine-tuning / RAG implementation	• Fine-tune model (if required) on custom data
• Implement RAG pipeline for knowledge-grounded answers	GenAI Engineer	3 Sprints
1.7	Evaluation and feedback	• Perform evaluation using test prompts
• SME to provide feedback on relevance, tone, and hallucinations
• Refine model or prompts accordingly	Data Scientist / SME	2 Sprints
1.8	Model Validation	• Validate model performance on internal and out-of-sample data
• Communicate accuracy, coherence, and robustness to SME	Data Scientist	½ Sprint
1.9	Reporting & Communication	• Dashboard to show GenAI performance (e.g., prompt latency, feedback scores, usage stats)
• Final sign-off from SME	Data Scientist / Visualization / SME	½ Sprint
1.10	Production Deployment	• Deploy GenAI solution as API, chatbot, or within workflow
• Ensure access control, monitoring, rollback plans	Data Engineer / GenAI Engg	1 Sprint
1.11	Monitoring & Maintenance	• Continuously monitor performance, usage, and hallucinations
• Update prompts/models as needed
• Retrain or re-index as feedback evolves	Data Scientist	1 Sprint
1.12	ROI & Benefit Calculation	• Measure effort saved, customer satisfaction, cost reduction
• Present ROI metrics post-implementation	Business SME / Data Scientist	Measured over time
